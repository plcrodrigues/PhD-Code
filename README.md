# PhD-Code
Hello, this repository contains `python` code for reproducing some of the examples presented in my Ph.D. manuscript

For the moment (15th July 2019), it contains three scripts with examples :

- **Example 1** (*./examples/dimensionality-reduction/example1.py*)

  In this example, we compare the results of clasification with MDM when reducing the dimensionality of EEG recordings from the Physionet   MI dataset. We use the 'covpca' and 'gpcaRiemann' methods, as well as the SELg and SELb electrode selections. The user is referred to     Chapter 3 on my manuscript.

Cheers,
Pedro
